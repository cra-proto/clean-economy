<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Who can claim</h1>
<p>To claim the Clean Electricity ITC, you&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Be a taxable Canadian corporation (including a taxable Canadian corporation that is a member of a partnership)</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Have a qualified clean electricity project, and have acquired eligible clean electricity property that becomes available for use in the year</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective <span class="nowrap">November 28, 2023</span>, employers who elect to meet the labour requirements can avoid being limited to the reduced tax credit rate.</p>
<p>Refer to:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/business-tax-credits/clean-economy-itc/labour-requirements-itc.html">Avoid the reduced tax credit rate for clean economy ITCs</a></p>
<h2 id="more">Claiming one or more ITCs</h2>
<p>You can generally claim <strong>only one</strong> of the clean economy ITCs for the <strong>same</strong> eligible property. For example, you cannot claim the Clean Electricity ITC if you claim the Clean Technology ITC for a particular property.</p>
<p>You may claim&nbsp;<strong>multiple</strong> clean economy&nbsp;ITCs for the same project, if the project includes&nbsp;<strong>different&nbsp;types</strong> of eligible property.</p>
<p>Additionally, you <strong>can</strong> claim both the Clean Electricity ITC and the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-41200-investment-tax-credit/atlantic-investment-tax-credit.html">Atlantic investment tax credit</a> for the same property.</p>
