<p>A qualified clean electricity project must meet <strong>all</strong> the following conditions as confirmed in writing by NRCan:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The electricity will be produced from an eligible pathway</li>
    <li>Based on the most recent project plan, the expected carbon intensity is determined in accordance with the principles set out in subsection 127.48 (6) (calculation of carbon intensity) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> and can reasonably be expected to be achieved based on the project’s design</li>
    <li>
        If the project is intended to produce clean ammonia, you have demonstrated:
        <ul>
            <li>That the project can reasonably be expected to have sufficient production capacity to satisfy the needs of the ammonia production facility, and</li>
            <li>The feasibility of transporting electricity between the facilities, if the electricity production facility and its ammonia production facility are not co-located</li>

    <li>Site preparation, delivery, installation, testing, or other costs incurred to put the property into service</li>
    <li>In the case of a property that you manufacture for your own use, material, labour and overhead costs reasonably attributable to the property, but not any profit which might have been earned had the asset been sold</li>
</ul>
<p>The capital cost of eligible clean electricity property must be reduced by:</p>

<p>Amounts of assistance that are repaid in a tax year or are no longer expected to be received in the year may be added to the capital cost of eligible clean electricity property for determining the Clean Electricity ITC for the year.</p>
<p>The cost of certain property that is used in both electricity and ammonia production will be allocated separately between the categories for such equipment.</p>

<p>If any part of the capital cost of a taxpayer’s eligible clean electricity property is unpaid on the day that is 180 days after the end of the taxation year of a taxpayer in which the property became available for use, that part of the cost is added to the capital cost of the property at the time it is paid.</p>
