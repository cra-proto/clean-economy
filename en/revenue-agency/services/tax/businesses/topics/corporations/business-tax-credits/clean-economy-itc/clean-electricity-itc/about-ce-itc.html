<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">What is the Clean Electricity ITC</h1>
<p>The Clean Electricity ITC is a refundable tax credit that applies to eligible clean electricity property that is acquired <strong>from</strong>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">March 28, 2023</span> and that becomes available for use <strong>on or before</strong> <span class="nowrap">December 31, 2034</span>.</p>
<p>This credit is related to the production of clean electricity with a carbon intensity of less than <span class="nowrap">4 kilograms</span> of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2e</sub>) per kilogram of electricity produced; and if applicable, the production of clean ammonia that uses a feedstock of clean electricity produced by the qualified project.</p>
