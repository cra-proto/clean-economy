<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Get ready to claim</h1>
<p>Prepare your claim and if you choose, elect into the labour requirements to get the regular credit rate for the Clean Electricity ITC.</p>
<p>If your project includes different types of property, you may be able to claim multiple Clean Economy ITCs for the same project.</p>
<p>Refer to:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/business-tax-credits/clean-economy-itc/clean-electricity-itc/who-claim-ch-itc.html#more">Claiming one or more ITCs</a></p>
<h2 id="max">Avoid the reduced credit rate</h2>
<p>You must elect to meet certain labour requirements for prevailing wages and apprenticeship standards to benefit from the regular credit rate of the ITC.</p>
<p>If you elect to meet the labour requirements but fail to do so, there are&nbsp;financial consequences for <span class="nowrap">non-compliance</span>. Responsibility for satisfying the labour requirements is on the corporation claiming the credit or a partnership where at least one partner is claiming the Clean Electricity ITC.</p>
<p>If you do not elect to meet the labour requirements, the credit rate will be reduced by 10 percentage points.</p>
<p>The labour requirements apply to covered workers for work that is performed on or after <span class="nowrap">November 28, 2023.</span></p>
